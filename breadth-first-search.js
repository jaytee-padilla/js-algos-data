// ***** ITERATIVE *****
// create a queue (will be using an array in this case)
// create a variable that will store the values of nodes visited

// place the root node into the queue

// Loop as long as there is anything in the queue:
// Dequeue a node from the queue and push the value of that dequeued node into the variable that stores the value of nodes visited
// If there is a left property on the node that was dequeued, add the left property's node to the queue
// If there is a right property on the node that was dequeued, add the right property's node to the queue

// return the variable that stores the values of nodes visited
